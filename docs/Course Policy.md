# Marking & Feedback

Written answers and file submissions will be marked by your TA using a rubric.  Assignments submitted by the due date will be graded and returned seven days after the due date.  Short comments will be provided where applicable on written/file submissions and answer keys will be posted for the quizzes.  If you want further feedback on you lab assignment ask your TA in lab or by email.

## Late Penalties

Assessment submissions will be accepted without late penalty for seven days.  Late assignments **waive their right** to prompt grading/feedback.  Late assignments will be marked whenever is convenient for your TA (could be as late as the end of term).  Once assessment grades and answer keys are posted, **submissions will no longer be accepted**.

## Quizzes

Canvas quizzes have very limited functionality (eg. fill in the blank questions can't handle spelling errors).  To account for this I will download all responses and use a python script to mark quizzes.  I'll post the updated scores to Canvas and an answer key once the submission window has closed (7 days after the due date).  These scores will be reflected in the grade book, but the changes won't be reflected on the individual quiz questions in canvas.

## Concessions

If you require an [Academic Concession](https://www.arts.ubc.ca/degree-planning/academic-performance/academic-concession/) please email me promptly so that we can work together to figure out an accommodation for your situation.  You are not obligated to explain your personal circumstances to me to justify the concession, my inent is to be accomodating.  However, you must to communicate any need for a concession in a timely manner.  If you require multiple concessions I may refer you to [Arts Advising](https://www.arts.ubc.ca/student-support/academic-support/academic-advising/).


# COVID-19

## Provincial Mask Mandate

Provincial Health Orders and UBC policy now mandate masks in all indoor public spaces on campus. These spaces include classrooms, residence halls, libraries, and common areas. Students who wish to request an exemption to the indoor mask mandate must do so based on one of the grounds for exemption detailed in the PHO Order on Face Coverings (COVID-19). Such requests must be made through the Center for Accessibility (Vancouver campus).
 
After review, students that are approved for this accommodation will be provided with a letter of accommodation to share with faculty members teaching courses in which they are registered. In the intervening time, these students are welcome in the class. 
 
Mask wearing protects you as well as others in your environment. Let’s do everything we can as a community to stop the spread of this virus.

## Absences

If you are sick (with COVID or otherwise), please stay home to protect others and take care of yourself.  Lectures will be made available online and you may attend lab via zoom.  Accomodations will be made avaialbe to studetns who need them due to illnesses.  See the accoomodations section for more details.

# Academic Integrity:

The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.

Plagiarism and cheating will be taken very seriously.  The first incident of plagiarism/copying/cheating will result in a zero for the assignment.  Further incidents will be reported to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline in addition to a zero.  A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found [here](https://learningcommons.ubc.ca/academic-integrity/Links)

Though you may work together with your classmates on the assignments and help each other, ALL STUDENTS MUST SUBMIT THEIR OWN ORIGINAL WORK. This means that your maps must be your own, and your answers must be in your own words. Failure to submit your own work can result in failing the assignment or worse, so please be careful. See the Academic Integrity section of the Syllabus for more information.
