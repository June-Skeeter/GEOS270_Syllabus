## Learning Outcomes

This course will expose you to key concepts and tools used to collect, map, and interpret geographic data.  We will learn how geospatial data can be used to aid decision-making, complement scientific analysis, assist with urban planning, and help inform policy-making.  You will gain practical experience using geospatial data to solve problems in both the natural and human realms.  This term we will cover:

* How GIS functions and how it can be applied to solve problems.
* How phenomena are represented as geospatial data in a GIS.
* How to implement geospatial analysis methods.
* Visualizing geospatial data and principles of good map design. 
* Sources of error in GIS analysis and output.
* The ethical implications of GIS analysis.
* GIS workflows and collaborating to complete a GIS project.

My name is June and I am a non-binary geographer, researcher, and educator.  I have been living as an uninvited guest on unceded Coast Salish Territory since 2015 and (will soon receive) a PhD in Geography from the University of British Columbia in 2022.

I have been teaching GEOS 270 since 2020.  I am passionate about teaching Geographic Information Science and using Geographic Information Systems as a tool to address social and ecological justice issues.  My principal aim this semester is to provide a holistic introduction to the study of Geographic Information Science and application of Geographic Information Systems.

I use GIS extensively is my research on climate change in the wetland ecosystems.  For my PhD, I studied greenhouse gas exchange remote [Arctic Ecosystems](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/full/10.1139/as-2021-0034).  Now I am working for the [UBC Micrometeorology Lab](https://blogs.ubc.ca/saraknox/) studying greenhouse gas exchange in local wetlands in Vancouver.  When I'm not working, I like to spend my free time hiking, gardening, foraging, and going to drag shows.
