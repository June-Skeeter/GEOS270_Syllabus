# Making a Map

Now that you've used kernel density to identify the location of the pump, we'll display it on a map layout.

## Creating a Layout
Follow the steps as outlined and refer to the video below to add a new layout.

**1)** Click the Insert tab and select Layout.  Choose an appropriate page size.
* Letter size is good for most maps in this class, only use the bigger ones if you are making a poster.


<div style="overflow: hidden;
  padding-top: 56.25%;
  position: relative">
  <iframe src="AddLayout.mp4" title="Processes" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"
    style="border: 0;
   height: 100%;
   left: 0;
   position: absolute;
   top: 0;
   width: 100%;">

 </iframe>
</div>
<a href="AddLayout.mp4" target="_blank">View Image in New Tab</a>

## Adding Map Elements
Follow the steps as outlined and refer to the video below to add the necessary map elements.

**1)** Add a legend.  Remove any unwanted items from the legend using the check boxes.  Change the symbology of Kernel Density to 5 classes so it fits on the legend better and edit the layer name to make it more clear.  Reorder the legend items if desired.
* Legends items have many different settings we can fine tune.  For now, we'll just change a few.
* You can add/remove & reorder legend items using the check box on the right.
* Changing the number of classes in the Kernel Density layer makes it fit better.
* Slowly double clicking on an item in the table of contents on the left allows you to edit the text.  You can change layer names so they make more sense.

**2)** Add a a title using the Straight Text (see video).  Give your map an appropriate title and font size
* Titles should be concise and descriptive.
* They should be the largest font element on the map

**3)** Use the same procedure to add a data source, creator name, and date to the map.
* It is important to credit data sources
* List yourself as the creator
* Add a date so the reader knows when the map was created
* The credit text can be smaller and "tucked away" at the bottom of the map

**4)** Add a north arrow & scale bar
* Make sure to change your units to metric!

## **Question 12)**
Save your layout as a .pdf and submit it to canvas.
* Your map should look something like the map shown below. Different colors, element sizes, etc. are fine.  But it should have all the map elements listed above.

<div style="overflow: hidden;
  padding-top: 56.25%;
  position: relative">
  <iframe src="Final_Map.png" title="Processes" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"
    style="border: 0;
   height: 100%;
   left: 0;
   position: absolute;
   top: 0;
   width: 100%;">

## Save your project.

Click Save in the top left of the Arc Pro window.
* If you are working on a Geography Department Lab computer, make sure to save your work the the H:/ drive and log off properly.  See the video of on the Lab Details page on canvas for a more detailed explanation.
